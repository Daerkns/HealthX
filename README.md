# HealthX

Project - HealthX

Current Idea Roadmap  -

1. Point based Module -  - whether we go through the activity associated with the reminder, for example, getting up to stretch/ looking at distant object to prevent eye strain. This is to make the software feel more interactive, and to accumulate "Health points" so that we can feel good about ourselves as we accumulate said points.

2. Log/Journal Module  -  Date and times are recorded for statistical purposes - how many points were earned at some particular day, how many points were earned in a week/month, and average points the user earned per day.

3. Profile Module -  Username+Password. Your progress is saved to your own profile. Amazing synergy with Log/Journal system. Individual progresses tracked.

4. Words of Encouragement Module - "Good job!", "Keep up the good work!" if you decide to go through with expected activity. Opposite can be implemented as well - "Better luck next time!" - for not going through activity.

5. Additional feature of Mindfulness/Meditation. 1 reminder per 24 hours.

6. Additional features - Drinking water, sunlight exposure, dietary fiber. Reminder times to be decided.

Aesthetic Roadmap - 

1.  The Golden Ratio - Research on it and other similar ideas of making things look attractive.
